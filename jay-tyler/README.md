## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are building this to get a better app understanding of handlebars.  Learning to better utilize templates allow us to add a more efficient workflow for populating our page with a large number of articles.  

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
First you need to clone the repository from github onto their local machine.  From project directory they would settup a live-server or node in order to display the web app in a browser.  There is currently no backend database.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
The blog utilizes vanilla JS, HTML, CSS.  We linked jQuery and handlebars from CDN's to assist with dom maniputation and HTNML templating.

## Change Log
